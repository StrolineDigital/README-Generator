  WHEN I enter my project title
  THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
  WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
  THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
  WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
  THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled     License that explains which license the application is covered under
  WHEN I enter my GitHub username
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
